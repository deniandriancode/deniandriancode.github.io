[{"content":"Learning is a tiresome activity, you need to put a lot of effort and time when learning something, this is even true when learning something by yourself, like programming, since nobody is going to remind you when to study, when to review your note, when to exercise, what to study after you finished the current topic, in other word, you need to put extra effort because nobody is going to guide you whatsoever. Which is why keeping record of your learning journey is very important so you can know how far have you progressed, how far are you from your goals, what need to be evaluated from your previous experience and so forth.\nOne of the easiest way to keeping record of your learning journey is by taking a note. Now, there are a lot of ways to take a note nowadays, from using the notebook and pen to using computer or smartphone. However, when taking a note while learning programming I would highly recommend using digital based note taking method, or in this case, a computer, why? Because when you learn programming, most of the time you will be on your computer typing some code, that\u0026rsquo;s why using computer for taking a note will make it easier since you don\u0026rsquo;t have to switch around and write on a notebook, you can just switch to your note taking application as you learn.\nThere are a lot of note taking applications for computer, however here I want to show you how you can use web development as your note taking platform, and why you should use it especially is you are learning programming.\nRapid Change of Information Programming, just like other fields of technology, is evolving in a rapid speed. A tutorial on how to use certain framework in programming from 2 years ago might no be relevant by now since the framework has gone through some major update (this is my personal experience by the way). Everyday the developers keep adding new features and fixing bugs to make the software better, sometimes it takes several months to finish, sometimes it takes only several days to finish, in short, it changes really fast. Not to mention when a particular software got an update, it might affects other softwares, for instance, if the browser got an update, your javascript knowledge might need to be updated as well. If you were to write all this information on a notebook, it will get confusing real quick since your information on that notebook will most likely outdated, and there is now way to update the information unless writing on a new page, which is a waste. Moreover, if you need to include a link to certain website or documentation, it is difficult to do in notebook, you can\u0026rsquo;t just click it and open it on your browser. And there is picture and diagram, all of which cannot be stored easily on a notebook.\nWith that being said, the most logical thing to do to take a note while learning programming is to use digital platform, there are a lot of note taking programs for computer, but here I will use web development as a tool to take a note while learning programming. You maybe ask, why use web development instead of just use an existing program? Well, you can actually, but why just learn one thing if you can learn two at the same time? Of course this is just my opinion and you can completely ignore this article and throw it on a trash bin, however what I want to emphasize here is that how putting extra effort on learning something is actually a shortcut, or should I say \u0026ldquo;The easiest way to learn something is to learn it the hard way\u0026rdquo;, that is to put more effort on it, to put the work on it. Because the more difficult something to get, the more precious it is in our heart.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t learn web development! That\u0026rsquo;s compeletely fine, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to build a full-blown web app for your note taking platform, just basic knowledge of html and css is enough since what you will do is just storing your note on the web. And when I mean on the web, I mean online, that is you can access the note from any device that browse the internet.\nWait, there are already exist such services! I know, and you can use that service, however when you build your own, you can learn how the internet works and the basic of web technology, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what your expertise is, you will use the web every now and then, so yeah, it won\u0026rsquo;t hurt learning a little bit of web development.\nEnough with the reasoning, let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can use web development as our note taking platform while learning programming.\nNote Taking using Web Development I know I said that I will show you how we can use web development as your note taking platform, however I won\u0026rsquo;t be specific since note taking is different from person to person. What you need to build is just a simple web platform where you can store your notes, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how you want it to look like or what it capable of, the most important one is that it can store notes easily and you can retrieve your note easily. There are a lot of free services to host such application. Here are just some that I know, you can use other services if you want.\n1. Wordpress 2. GitHub Page 3. Vercel Don\u0026rsquo;t Over Engineer your Website Use the Already Existing Services 1. Obsidian 2. Google Keep 3.
