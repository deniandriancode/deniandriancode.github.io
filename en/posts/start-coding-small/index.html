Coding and programming are two different things, in a nutshell, programming is applying some logic while coding is actually typing the applied logic into machine-readable instruction, read this awesome article from freeCodeCamp.\nYou can do programming wherever you are, you don’t have to sit in front of your computer since applying some logic don’t necessarily need a computer.Think about how you study math, that’s how you study programming, more or less.\nStudying coding, on the other hand, requires you to be in front of your computer and type some code. Now, no matter how much you love programming and coding, you still have to leave your computer, you got other things to do and booting up your computer just to be able to study code might feel a bit of a hassle.\nLearning programming is important but if you can’t implement what you have learnt, it is practically useless, in other word, you just waste your time. That’s why you also need to learn how to code, learn how to make you logic become reality and solve real world problems.\nBooting up a computer just to typing some confusing text and make your brain hurt doesn’t sound very fun, that’s being said, in this article I want to share with you, how you can learn coding while making it fun, or at least making coding less of a hassle.\nMeaningless Things and Why It’s Actually Good What I mean with meaningless here is things that are not exciting to do, it could be anything from doing daily habits to working on the same problem multiple times.\nFor example, when you are hungry, you search for something to eat, maybe you go to the kitchen and start making something or just order it using online service, in the end you have something to eat and start devouring it to satisfy your hunger.\nSearching for food when we are hungry is an activity we do in daily basis, we do it so often that sometimes we didn’t think about it too much, hungry means search for food to eat, done, there is no excitement in doing such activity since we do it everyday—unless if we are visiting a restaurant then it’s a different story.\nWhen we do such activity without all of this emotional attributes, we actually using less energy satisfy our need, since we just focus on doing the activity, our body will use the energy to complete such task and not using it to other things like the feeling of excitement.\nIn other word, meaningless things are just things we do automatically we didn’t give it much attention since we didn’t really have to. Because, as you can tell, giving attention to something is using a lot of energy.\nThe More Often You Do Something, The More It Becomes Part of Your Life As long as I can remember, I never washed my dish after I use it. Unless my parents told me to do so, washing my own dish has never been in my mind. I feel burdened when I have to wash my own dish despite the simplicity of the task, until I got into highschool and realize that I need to start doing things on my own since I will soon become an adult.\nOn my mind, onee of the task that I need to start doing it on my own is washing my own dish. So I start washing my own dish as soon as I finished my meal. For the first few times it feels unnatural and something that I should not be doing, but I keep telling myself that if I can’t do this simple thing on my own, I won’t be able to live by myself.\nSince then, everytime I finished my meal, I wash the dish almost instantenously. Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and now anytime I finished my meal, if I don’t wash the dish I feel something is missing, washing my dish has been part of my identity, it is something I can’t miss in my life.\nWashing my own dish has turned from being something unnatural for me into something I can’t live without, all of that because of how often I do that activity, the more I do it the more I convince myself that this is the right thing to do, that this is part of myself I can’t miss.\nCoding is not very different, it may be something unnatural for you now, however if you keep doing it in daily basis, it will eventually become part of yourself. When something has become part of yourself, you will do it voluntarily without any burden.\nExcitement is Burden for Your Brain Excitement and motivation sounds like a good thing especially when doing something new, well, it is, but without proper management of this burst of energy, it will backfires you.\nUsually, poor management of excitement or motivation will cause the following pattern:\nMotivation kicks in You start doing what your motivation told to do You do it until you tired Motivation fades You lost interest on doing it again You abandon it At least, that’s what happen to me, a lot.\nI experience this because when I have the motivation, I have this mindset on my brain that tells me “keep going, just one more thing” everytime I want to rest, and since I don’t know when I will have this kind of motivation I follow it and endup burning out my energy.\nStart Small In the previos paragraphs, I tell you that you need to something, in this case coding, a lot to make it to be part of yourself, but then I told you that doing things a lot will cause burnout and makes you abandon your work, isn’t that counterintuitive? Well, not really, not if you start small.\nHow small is small enough? The answer is the smallest possible, it is impossible you can’t do it. Take coding for example, how small of coding is the smallest possible? If you open up your text editor or IDE, and then you start typing out codes from, say, stackoverflow, that’s enough, at least for me.\nIs it ridiculous? Yes, perhaps, but as long as you open your text editor and writing some code, that’s good enough. You are not trying to build the next Facebook or Google, what you are trying to build is the mentality that coding is part of yourself, so start as small as possible, as long as you write some code on daily basis, that’s good enough. One of the key thing here is to lower you expectation. It may looks unnecessary because of how simple the task you need to do, but just keep doing it, until it becomes natural.\nKeep Things in Line The idea of start small is to make coding a habit, something that attached to your identity, I keep saying your identity or yourself and not you life because when something becomes part of yourself, it is something that you believe that it’s the right thing to do, when you do something you believe is right you will put effort to make it happen.\nStart coding from small amount helps you to make it something you do in daily basis, we often forget something we do rarely, to make coding sticks, you have to do it often enough you can’t forget about it.\nAfterword Coding is more to physical activity in a sense that the main focus is to apply the concept you learned in programming into real world code. There are many ways to make coding a fun activity, what I mention above is just my opinion. If you have other methods that works for you to make coding fun, use that instead, everyone has their own method of approaching coding, choose the one that works for you.\nThat’s it for now, I’ll see you on another post.\nStay safe.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>If you are learning programming or computer science related stuff,
chances are you will write some code. Coding and programming are two
different things, in a nutshell, programming is applying some logic
while coding is actually typing the applied logic into machine-readable
instruction, read <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/difference-between-coding-and-programming/">this awesome article</a>
from freeCodeCamp.</p>
<p>You can do programming wherever you are, you don&rsquo;t have to sit in
front of your computer since applying some logic don&rsquo;t necessarily
need a computer.Think about how you study math, that&rsquo;s how you study
programming, more or less.</p>
<p>Studying coding, on the other hand, requires you to be in front of
your computer and type some code. Now, no matter how much you love
programming and coding, you still have to leave your computer, you
got other things to do and booting up your computer just to be able
to study code might feel a bit of a hassle.</p>
<p>Learning programming is important but if you can&rsquo;t implement what
you have learnt, it is practically useless, in other word, you just
waste your time. That&rsquo;s why you also need to learn how to code, learn
how to make you logic become reality and solve real world problems.</p>
<p>Booting up a computer just to typing some confusing text and make
your brain hurt doesn&rsquo;t sound very fun, that&rsquo;s being said, in this
article I want to share with you, how you can learn coding while
making it fun, or at least making coding less of a hassle.</p>
<h2 id="meaningless-things-and-why-its-actually-good">Meaningless Things and Why It&rsquo;s Actually Good<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#meaningless-things-and-why-its-actually-good">#</a></h2>
<p>What I mean with meaningless here is things that are not exciting
to do, it could be anything from doing daily habits to working on
the same problem multiple times.</p>
<p>For example, when you are hungry, you search for something to eat,
maybe you go to the kitchen and start making something or just order
it using online service, in the end you have something to eat and
start devouring it to satisfy your hunger.</p>
<p>Searching for food when we are hungry is an activity we do in daily
basis, we do it so often that sometimes we didn&rsquo;t think about it too
much, hungry means search for food to eat, done, there is no excitement
in doing such activity since we do it everyday—unless if we are visiting
a restaurant then it&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>When we do such activity without all of this emotional attributes, we actually
using less energy satisfy our need, since we just focus on doing the activity,
our body will use the energy to complete such task and not using it to other
things like the feeling of excitement.</p>
<p>In other word, meaningless things are just things we do automatically we
didn&rsquo;t give it much attention since we didn&rsquo;t really have to. Because, as you
can tell, giving attention to something is using a lot of energy.</p>
<h2 id="the-more-often-you-do-something-the-more-it-becomes-part-of-your-life">The More Often You Do Something, The More It Becomes Part of Your Life<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-more-often-you-do-something-the-more-it-becomes-part-of-your-life">#</a></h2>
<p>As long as I can remember, I never washed my dish after I use it. Unless
my parents told me to do so, washing my own dish has never been in my
mind. I feel burdened when I have to wash my own dish despite the simplicity
of the task, until I got into highschool and realize that I need to start
doing things on my own since I will soon become an adult.</p>
<p>On my mind, onee of the task that I need to start doing it on my own is
washing my own dish. So I start washing my own dish as soon as I finished
my meal. For the first few times it feels unnatural and something that I
should not be doing, but I keep telling myself that if I can&rsquo;t do this simple
thing on my own, I won&rsquo;t be able to live by myself.</p>
<p>Since then, everytime I finished my meal, I wash the dish almost instantenously.
Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and now anytime I finished
my meal, if I don&rsquo;t wash the dish I feel something is missing, washing my dish
has been part of my identity, it is something I can&rsquo;t miss in my life.</p>
<p>Washing my own dish has turned from being something unnatural for me into
something I can&rsquo;t live without, all of that because of how often I do that
activity, the more I do it the more I convince myself that this is the right
thing to do, that this is part of myself I can&rsquo;t miss.</p>
<p>Coding is not very different, it may be something unnatural for you now, however
if you keep doing it in daily basis, it will eventually become part of yourself.
When something has become part of yourself, you will do it voluntarily without
any burden.</p>
<h2 id="excitement-is-burden-for-your-brain">Excitement is Burden for Your Brain<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#excitement-is-burden-for-your-brain">#</a></h2>
<p>Excitement and motivation sounds like a good thing especially when doing something
new, well, it is, but without proper management of this <em>burst of energy</em>, it will
backfires you.</p>
<p>Usually, poor management of excitement or motivation will cause the following pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>Motivation kicks in</li>
<li>You start doing what your motivation told to do</li>
<li>You do it until you tired</li>
<li>Motivation fades</li>
<li>You lost interest on doing it again</li>
<li>You abandon it</li>
</ol>
<p>At least, that&rsquo;s what happen to me, a lot.</p>
<p>I experience this because when I have the motivation, I have this mindset on my brain
that tells me &ldquo;keep going, just one more thing&rdquo; everytime I want to rest, and since
I don&rsquo;t know when I will have this kind of motivation I follow it and endup burning
out my energy.</p>
<h2 id="start-small">Start Small<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#start-small">#</a></h2>
<p>In the previos paragraphs, I tell you that you need to something, in this case coding,
a lot to make it to be part of yourself, but then I told you that doing things a lot
will cause burnout and makes you abandon your work, isn&rsquo;t that counterintuitive? Well,
not really, not if you start small.</p>
<p>How small is small enough? The answer is the smallest possible, it is impossible you
can&rsquo;t do it. Take coding for example, how small of coding is the smallest possible?
If you open up your text editor or IDE, and then you start typing out codes from, say,
stackoverflow, that&rsquo;s enough, at least for me.</p>
<p>Is it ridiculous? Yes, perhaps, but as long as you open your text editor and writing
some code, that&rsquo;s good enough. You are not trying to build the next Facebook or Google,
what you are trying to build is the mentality that coding is part of yourself, so start
as small as possible, as long as you write some code on daily basis, that&rsquo;s good enough.
One of the key thing here is to lower you expectation. It may looks unnecessary because
of how simple the task you need to do, but just keep doing it, until it becomes natural.</p>
<h2 id="keep-things-in-line">Keep Things in Line<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#keep-things-in-line">#</a></h2>
<p>The idea of start small is to make coding a habit, something that attached to your
identity, I keep saying your identity or yourself and not you life because when something
becomes part of yourself, it is something that you believe that it&rsquo;s the right thing
to do, when you do something you believe is right you will put effort to make it happen.</p>
<p>Start coding from small amount helps you to make it something you do in daily basis,
we often forget something we do rarely, to make coding sticks, you have to do it often
enough you can&rsquo;t forget about it.</p>
<h2 id="afterword">Afterword<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#afterword">#</a></h2>
<p>Coding is more to physical activity in a sense that the main focus is to apply the concept
you learned in programming into real world code. There are many ways to make coding a
fun activity, what I mention above is just my opinion. If you have other methods that works
for you to make coding fun, use that instead, everyone has their own method of approaching
coding, choose the one that works for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, I&rsquo;ll see you on another post.</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>
