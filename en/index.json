One of the most important use of array is that is it used to implement other more complex data structures such as linked list, binary tree and hash tables.\nBut what is greater that array? Yup, dynamic array.\nWe will create an echo program to see how we can implement dynamic array in C programming language.\nNow, C doesn\u0026rsquo;t support dynamic array natively, however we can implement it easily, this article will show you how.\nReallocate Memory Before implementing dynamic array in C, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look on how to realloc memory in C using realloc.\nrealloc has the following syntax:\nvoid *realloc(void *_Nullable ptr, size_t size); pretty easy to use.\nHere is a code to demonstrate the use of realloc.\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; int main() { int* ptr = (int*) malloc(2 * sizeof(int)); *(ptr + 0) = 7; *(ptr + 1) = 5; // *(ptr + 2) = 3; // uncommenting this will result in undefined behavior ptr = (int*) realloc(3 * sizeof(int)); *(ptr + 2) = 3; // valid free(ptr); return 0; } Using realloc is pretty straight forward, you only need to provide the pointer you wanted to resize and the new size.\nEcho Program Let\u0026rsquo;s say we have a program that capture user input and then store it in a pointer, after the user input new line, the program will print it to the standard output.\nHere is one way to implement it.\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main() { char s[10]; int c, i; i = 0; while (i \u0026lt; 9 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (c = getchar()) != \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;) { s[i++] = c; } s[i] = \u0026#39;\\0\u0026#39;; printf(\u0026#34;%s\\n\u0026#34;, s); return 0; } The code above will work just fine however, it will only able to print up to 9 characters long (10 characters with the \\0 delimiter).\nWhat if user input more than 9 characters? Well, we can just allocate big enough memory to store the user\u0026rsquo;s input. However, this might not be the best choice for our problem because allocating such big memory with no use is just impractical. User can input only 5 characters but if we already allocated, say 1000 characters, the rest of the memory will be unused.\nSince we never know the exact length of the user\u0026rsquo;s input, how about we start with small array and then increase the size of the array accordingly. This is where we use dynamic memory allocation.\nRewriting the above code will give us the following.\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; int main() { char* s = (char*) malloc(10 * sizeof(char)); int c, i; i = 0; while (i \u0026lt; 9 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (c = getchar()) != \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;) { *(s+i) = c; ++i; } *(s+i) = \u0026#39;\\0\u0026#39;; printf(\u0026#34;%s\\n\u0026#34;, s); free(s); return 0; } Yes, it is still static.\nWe need to use realloc to resize the pointer s.\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; #define BUFSIZE 8 int main() { char* s = (char*) malloc(BUFSIZE * sizeof(char)); int c, i, j; i = 0; j = 1; while ((c = getchar()) != \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;) { *(s+i) = c; ++i; if (i % BUFSIZE == 0) { ++j; s = (char*) realloc(s, BUFSIZE * j * sizeof(char)); } } *(s+i) = \u0026#39;\\0\u0026#39;; printf(\u0026#34;%s\\n\u0026#34;, s); free(s); return 0; } Now the program will work as expected. Compile using -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address using gcc to check if the program compiles correctly.\nAfterword We have seen how we can implement a dynamic array in C programming language, there are a lot of things we can improve in our echo program like error handling and non-ascii characters. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it to you to do that.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for now, I\u0026rsquo;ll see you on another one.\nStay safe!\n","permalink":"/en/posts/dynamic-array-in-c-simplified/","summary":"Array data structure is really useful, it can used to to store value with same data types, we can access it really easy, updating the value of array is also a trivial thing to do.

Your computer needs a way to \u0026rsquo;labelize\u0026rsquo; files in its filesystem. Remember, everything is a file in linux. One way to do this is to put a unique integer value to the file. This unique integer value is what we called the inode number, which is a number that\u0026rsquo;s used to identify an inode. The inode is a data structure that describe a file-system object.\nEach file associated with inode, which is identified by an inode number. The inode contains metadata about a file, that is it has data that describe the data inside a file. A directory is just a file containing a list of inodes.\nAn inode can only associated with one file. When you move a file, you actually just putting a different path to the inode. Changing inode means changing the identity of a file at hardware level, so it is not a trivial thing to do and we rarely need to do that.\nWhat is filename? A filename or file name is a name used to uniquely identify a computer file in a file system.\n~ Wikipedia\nFilename is pretty obvious, filename to a file is like a title to a book. The definition from wikipedia said that is a unique identifier but actually it must be unique only for current directory. You can, for example, have a file named fin.txt in ~/.config and ~/Downloads.\nIt is what\u0026rsquo;s searched by software like find. File manager software also list filename when displaying files instead of inode.\nChanging a filename is easy compared to changing an inode. When you change a filename, you just changing an attribute of a file and not its identity.\nHard link Every file in Linux Filesystem starts with a single hard link. It maps the filename into the file. Let\u0026rsquo;s say I have a file and its filename, I will call the file as FILE (pretty obvious) and the filename as HARD_LINK_1, the simple way to visual the relation between the two is as the following:\nHARD_LINK_1 -\u0026gt; FILE It implies that if I refer the HARD_LINK_1 I actually referring FILE, any action I do to HARD_LINK_1 is done to FILE.\nIf I create another hard link that links to FILE, let\u0026rsquo;s say HARD_LINK_2, now FILE has two hard links. Here is how it looks like:\nHARD_LINK_1 -\u0026gt; FILE HARD_LINK_2 -\u0026gt; FILE Both HARD_LINK_1 and HARD_LINK_2 has the same inode since both are referring to the same file FILE. If I change the content via HARD_LINK_1, the content will also changed when I access it from HARD_LINK_2. When I delete HARD_LINK_1, the FILE will not gone since it has one remaining link HARD_LINK_2, it will be removed from the filesystem when all links to the data has been removed.\nHard link only work for regular files and if the new hard links exist on the same filesystem.\nSoft link Unlike hard link that links the filename to the actual data, or inode if you prefer, the soft link (also known as symbolic link) links to the filename. Say that I have a file, a filename, and a soft link, the file is called FILE, the filename is called FNAME and the soft link is called SOFT_LINK. Here is how it looks like:\nFNAME -\u0026gt; FILE SOFT_LINK -\u0026gt; FNAME When I access SOFT_LINK I\u0026rsquo;m actually accessing the FNAME that access the FILE, in other words, when I use SOFT_LINK I don\u0026rsquo;t know about the FILE, all I know is that I\u0026rsquo;m accessing a file that has a filename named FNAME.\nThis raises a problem when FNAME is deleted, since there is no link left that links to FILE, it will be removed from the filesystem, however since SOFT_LINK only knows about FNAME it will still points to FNAME even though it is now didn\u0026rsquo;t exists in the filesystem. This situation is referred to as a dangling soft link.\nUsing ln Command We have talked about hard link and soft link. How do we create one? We can use the linux command ln to create hard links and soft links. The syntax is pretty simple.\nTo create a hard link, the syntax is as the following:\nln \u0026lt;source_file\u0026gt; \u0026lt;output_file\u0026gt; To create a soft link, just add the -s flag:\nln -s \u0026lt;source_file\u0026gt; \u0026lt;output_file\u0026gt; For example, if I have a file named hello.txt, to create the hard link in the same directory with the name hardlink_hello.txt I can type:\nln hello.txt hardlink_hello.txt if I want to create a soft link named softlink_hello.txt, I just need to add the -s flag, so:\nln -s hello.txt softlink_hello.txt Afterword There you have it, a short and simplified explanation about hard link and soft link in Linux. Using hard link and soft link are useful when you want to create a shortcut to a certain program or to give it to give it another name that suits you. You can create, for example, a soft link to cp program named copy, so whenever you want to copy something just type copy instead of cp, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why you want to do that but you can.\nAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s it for now.

Coding and programming are two different things, in a nutshell, programming is applying some logic while coding is actually typing the applied logic into machine-readable instruction, read this awesome article from freeCodeCamp.\nYou can do programming wherever you are, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to sit in front of your computer since applying some logic don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need a computer.Think about how you study math, that\u0026rsquo;s how you study programming, more or less.\nStudying coding, on the other hand, requires you to be in front of your computer and type some code. Now, no matter how much you love programming and coding, you still have to leave your computer, you got other things to do and booting up your computer just to be able to study code might feel a bit of a hassle.\nLearning programming is important but if you can\u0026rsquo;t implement what you have learnt, it is practically useless, in other word, you just waste your time. That\u0026rsquo;s why you also need to learn how to code, learn how to make you logic become reality and solve real world problems.\nBooting up a computer just to typing some confusing text and make your brain hurt doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound very fun, that\u0026rsquo;s being said, in this article I want to share with you, how you can learn coding while making it fun, or at least making coding less of a hassle.\nMeaningless Things and Why It\u0026rsquo;s Actually Good What I mean with meaningless here is things that are not exciting to do, it could be anything from doing daily habits to working on the same problem multiple times.\nFor example, when you are hungry, you search for something to eat, maybe you go to the kitchen and start making something or just order it using online service, in the end you have something to eat and start devouring it to satisfy your hunger.\nSearching for food when we are hungry is an activity we do in daily basis, we do it so often that sometimes we didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it too much, hungry means search for food to eat, done, there is no excitement in doing such activity since we do it everyday—unless if we are visiting a restaurant then it\u0026rsquo;s a different story.\nWhen we do such activity without all of this emotional attributes, we actually using less energy satisfy our need, since we just focus on doing the activity, our body will use the energy to complete such task and not using it to other things like the feeling of excitement.\nIn other word, meaningless things are just things we do automatically we didn\u0026rsquo;t give it much attention since we didn\u0026rsquo;t really have to. Because, as you can tell, giving attention to something is using a lot of energy.\nThe More Often You Do Something, The More It Becomes Part of Your Life As long as I can remember, I never washed my dish after I use it. Unless my parents told me to do so, washing my own dish has never been in my mind. I feel burdened when I have to wash my own dish despite the simplicity of the task, until I got into highschool and realize that I need to start doing things on my own since I will soon become an adult.\nOn my mind, onee of the task that I need to start doing it on my own is washing my own dish. So I start washing my own dish as soon as I finished my meal. For the first few times it feels unnatural and something that I should not be doing, but I keep telling myself that if I can\u0026rsquo;t do this simple thing on my own, I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to live by myself.\nSince then, everytime I finished my meal, I wash the dish almost instantenously. Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and now anytime I finished my meal, if I don\u0026rsquo;t wash the dish I feel something is missing, washing my dish has been part of my identity, it is something I can\u0026rsquo;t miss in my life.\nWashing my own dish has turned from being something unnatural for me into something I can\u0026rsquo;t live without, all of that because of how often I do that activity, the more I do it the more I convince myself that this is the right thing to do, that this is part of myself I can\u0026rsquo;t miss.\nCoding is not very different, it may be something unnatural for you now, however if you keep doing it in daily basis, it will eventually become part of yourself. When something has become part of yourself, you will do it voluntarily without any burden.\nExcitement is Burden for Your Brain Excitement and motivation sounds like a good thing especially when doing something new, well, it is, but without proper management of this burst of energy, it will backfires you.\nUsually, poor management of excitement or motivation will cause the following pattern:\nMotivation kicks in You start doing what your motivation told to do You do it until you tired Motivation fades You lost interest on doing it again You abandon it At least, that\u0026rsquo;s what happen to me, a lot.\nI experience this because when I have the motivation, I have this mindset on my brain that tells me \u0026ldquo;keep going, just one more thing\u0026rdquo; everytime I want to rest, and since I don\u0026rsquo;t know when I will have this kind of motivation I follow it and endup burning out my energy.\nStart Small In the previos paragraphs, I tell you that you need to something, in this case coding, a lot to make it to be part of yourself, but then I told you that doing things a lot will cause burnout and makes you abandon your work, isn\u0026rsquo;t that counterintuitive? Well, not really, not if you start small.\nHow small is small enough? The answer is the smallest possible, it is impossible you can\u0026rsquo;t do it. Take coding for example, how small of coding is the smallest possible? If you open up your text editor or IDE, and then you start typing out codes from, say, stackoverflow, that\u0026rsquo;s enough, at least for me.\nIs it ridiculous? Yes, perhaps, but as long as you open your text editor and writing some code, that\u0026rsquo;s good enough. You are not trying to build the next Facebook or Google, what you are trying to build is the mentality that coding is part of yourself, so start as small as possible, as long as you write some code on daily basis, that\u0026rsquo;s good enough. One of the key thing here is to lower you expectation. It may looks unnecessary because of how simple the task you need to do, but just keep doing it, until it becomes natural.\nKeep Things in Line The idea of start small is to make coding a habit, something that attached to your identity, I keep saying your identity or yourself and not you life because when something becomes part of yourself, it is something that you believe that it\u0026rsquo;s the right thing to do, when you do something you believe is right you will put effort to make it happen.\nStart coding from small amount helps you to make it something you do in daily basis, we often forget something we do rarely, to make coding sticks, you have to do it often enough you can\u0026rsquo;t forget about it.\nAfterword Coding is more to physical activity in a sense that the main focus is to apply the concept you learned in programming into real world code. There are many ways to make coding a fun activity, what I mention above is just my opinion. If you have other methods that works for you to make coding fun, use that instead, everyone has their own method of approaching coding, choose the one that works for you.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for now, I\u0026rsquo;ll see you on another post.\nStay safe.\n","permalink":"/en/posts/start-coding-small/","summary":"If you are learning programming or computer science related stuff, chances are you will write some code.

Which is why keeping record of your learning journey is very important so you can know how far have you progressed, how far are you from your goals, what need to be evaluated from your previous experience and so forth.\nOne of the easiest way to keeping record of your learning journey is by taking a note. Now, there are a lot of ways to take a note nowadays, from using the notebook and pen to using computer or smartphone. However, when taking a note while learning programming I would highly recommend using digital based note taking method, or in this case, a computer, why? Because when you learn programming, most of the time you will be on your computer typing some code, that\u0026rsquo;s why using computer for taking a note will make it easier since you don\u0026rsquo;t have to switch around and write on a notebook, you can just switch to your note taking application as you learn.\nThere are a lot of note taking applications for computer, however here I want to show you how you can use web development as your note taking platform, and why you should use it especially is you are learning programming.\nRapid Change of Information Programming, just like other fields of technology, is evolving in a rapid speed. A tutorial on how to use certain framework in programming from 2 years ago might no be relevant by now since the framework has gone through some major update (this is my personal experience by the way). Everyday the developers keep adding new features and fixing bugs to make the software better, sometimes it takes several months to finish, sometimes it takes only several days to finish, in short, it changes really fast. Not to mention when a particular software got an update, it might affects other softwares, for instance, if the browser got an update, your javascript knowledge might need to be updated as well. If you were to write all this information on a notebook, it will get confusing real quick since your information on that notebook will most likely outdated, and there is now way to update the information unless writing on a new page, which is a waste. Moreover, if you need to include a link to certain website or documentation, it is difficult to do in notebook, you can\u0026rsquo;t just click it and open it on your browser. And there is picture and diagram, all of which cannot be stored easily on a notebook.\nWith that being said, the most logical thing to do to take a note while learning programming is to use digital platform, there are a lot of note taking programs for computer, but here I will use web development as a tool to take a note while learning programming. You maybe ask, why use web development instead of just use an existing program? Well, you can actually, but why just learn one thing if you can learn two at the same time? Of course this is just my opinion and you can completely ignore this article and throw it on a trash bin, however what I want to emphasize here is that how putting extra effort on learning something is actually a shortcut, or should I say \u0026ldquo;The easiest way to learn something is to learn it the hard way\u0026rdquo;, that is to put more effort on it, to put the work on it. Because the more difficult something to get, the more precious it is in our heart.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t learn web development!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s compeletely fine, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to build a full-blown web app for your note taking platform, just basic knowledge of html and css is enough since what you will do is just storing your note on the web. And when I mean on the web, I mean online, that is you can access the note from any device that browse the internet.\nWait, there are already exist such services!\nI know, and you can use that service, however when you build your own, you can learn how the internet works and the basic of web technology, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what your expertise is, you will use the web every now and then, so yeah, it won\u0026rsquo;t hurt learning a little bit of web development.\nEnough with the reasoning, let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can use web development as our note taking platform while learning programming.\nNote Taking using Web Development I know I said that I will show you how we can use web development as your note taking platform, however I won\u0026rsquo;t be specific since note taking is different from person to person. What you need to build is just a simple web platform where you can store your notes, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how you want it to look like or what it capable of, the most important one is that it can store notes easily and you can retrieve your note easily. There are a lot of free services to host such application. Here are just some that I know, you can use other services if you want.\n1. Wordpress Everybody knows Wordpress, if you\u0026rsquo;ve been on the internet for quite sometime chances are you already encountered a website powered by wordpress. Wordpress is a content management system or CMS for short, to put simply it makes managing your content easier since you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about the technical detail and only focus on your business instead. It has a free tier where you can create a website a basically make your own blog. Because of its easy to use nature, even non-tech savy people have been using wordpress for their online needs, it becomes one the most popular CMS out there. Because of its easy to use and popularity, I would recommend you to use wordpress as your note taking platform while learning programming, it is free and you almost don\u0026rsquo;t need any web development skill to use it. You still can learn about web development from using wordpress like url, domain name, and other basic things about the internet. The reason I recommend wordpress first is because you can actually start taking note and put it online on the internet for you and the world to see, there are a lot templates to choose from, the website has been styled for you, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight error messages while taking a note.\n2. GitHub Pages GitHub offers a free hosting for static website called GitHub Pages. You can learn more on its official documentation. The difference between GitHub page and wordpress is that in GitHub page you really start from scratch, there is no template whatsoever. It is a good platform if you really want to learn the basic of web development like HTML and CSS while taking a note. While you can style it however you want, it all depends on your own effort since you really start building the website from scratch.\n3. Vercel Vercel is a bit specific because you have to use javascript to be able to use vercel. Javascript knowledge is required for using Vercel\u0026rsquo;s service, however if you want to use it as a note takning platform which only need a basic function such as storing and displaying text and images, you don\u0026rsquo;t need that much of javascript, a very basic knowledge of the language is enough to be able to use Vercel as your note taking platform. If you have a really creative ideas on your mind, Vercel is the perfect choice since it supports basically every major javascript framework, whatever you want to build using javascript, you can put it online on Vercel.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Over Engineer your Note Taking Platform Being creative and all is good when using web development as your note taking platform, but don\u0026rsquo;t get carried away and focus only on designing and developing it, unless if you want to delve into web development then it is a different story, if you want to use it just as your note taking platform however, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be good or eye-candy, it just have to be readable and easy for you to use. The idea of using web development as your note taking platform is that to make writing and accessing your note easier, since while learning programming you will most likely be in front of your monitor typing some code, it just makes more sense to choose what\u0026rsquo;s easier for you to use at that moment, plus you can learn the basic of the internet, things that you will encounter no matter what field of programming you focus on.\nUse the Already Existing Services Using web development as a note taking platform is not for everyone, if you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like learning a whole new field of programming just to store your note, that\u0026rsquo;s completely fine, as a matter of fact, if developing a whole new project just to store your note feels like a burden, don\u0026rsquo;t do it, since there are already a lot of existing services that offer similar things. Below I list just a few of them but you can certainly use other service if you want.\n1. Obsidian Obsidian is one of the most popular note taking app out there, it available on the web, pc, and mobile. It has a lot of features, it uses markdown syntax and stores the file in a markdown file, making transferring your notes across devices a lot easier. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what features you would expect from a note taking app, use Obsidian, it won\u0026rsquo;t dissapoint you.\n2. Google Keep I haven\u0026rsquo;t use Google Keep at all, to be honest I don\u0026rsquo;t even know google has a note taking app. Anyways, there is it there for you to use.\n3. GitHub This one is the GitHub itself and not the GitHub Pages I mentioned above. If you have a README.md file on your repository, GitHub will render it automatically when you visit the directory of that README.md file. Of course you can just use any file format and store it on GitHub, what makes it different is that you can easily change between \u0026ldquo;versions\u0026rdquo; of your note just like when you developing an actual software.\nAfterword I hope you learn something new after reading this post, even just a little, giving positive impact through my writing is something I always dream of especially in the field of programming and mathematics. All I said in this article is purely just my opinion, if you have other opinion on how to store a note when learning programming, let me know, I love sharing thoughts and ideas about anything related to programming and mathematics.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all from me, I hope we meet again on another post.\nStay safe.\n","permalink":"/en/posts/documenting-programming-journey-with-web-development/","summary":"Learning is a tiresome activity, you need to put a lot of effort and time when learning something, this is even true when learning something by yourself, like programming, since nobody is going to remind you when to study, when to review your note, when to exercise, what to study after you finished the current topic, in other word, you need to put extra effort because nobody is going to guide you whatsoever.","title":"Documenting Programming Journey with Web Development"},{"content":"Well, hello there!

The JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) is challenging, and many learners struggle with reading comprehension and sentence construction. However, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t reflect your worth or capabilities. Language learning is a journey that involves perseverance, and the fact that you\u0026rsquo;re taking on this challenge is commendable!\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s break down some strategies and resources that can help make studying for the JLPT more manageable and effective:\nStrategies for Studying Reading Comprehension: Start with Simplified Materials:\nBegin with reading materials that match your current proficiency level. Graded readers or JLPT-specific practice books can be a great start. Websites like NHK Easy News provide news articles in simplified Japanese, making it easier to build comprehension gradually. Active Reading Techniques:\nAnnotate Texts: As you read, highlight or underline unfamiliar words and phrases. Write notes in the margins to summarize paragraphs or sections. Summarize: After reading a passage, try to summarize it in your own words, either in Japanese or in your native language. Ask Questions: As you read, ask yourself questions about the text to improve engagement and understanding. For example, \u0026ldquo;Who is the main character?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What is the author\u0026rsquo;s main point?\u0026rdquo; Increase Exposure to Different Texts:\nDiversify your reading materials. Read articles, stories, and essays on various topics to get used to different writing styles and vocabulary. Websites like Satori Reader and WaniKani provide reading materials with built-in language learning tools. Build Vocabulary Gradually:\nFocus on vocabulary lists specific to your JLPT level. Use apps like Anki or Memrise to create flashcards for frequent review. Incorporate new vocabulary into sentences and practice them regularly. Practice with Past Exams:\nPractice reading comprehension with past JLPT papers or mock tests. Familiarizing yourself with the test format can reduce anxiety and improve performance. Tips for Building Sentences in Japanese: Understand Basic Grammar Structures:\nMaster the fundamental sentence structures and particles in Japanese. Resources like Tae Kim’s Guide to Japanese Grammar or Genki textbooks are great for this. Practice constructing simple sentences and gradually increase complexity. Practice Sentence Patterns:\nMemorize common sentence patterns and use them as templates. For example, patterns for expressing opinions, describing actions, or giving reasons. Use tools like Bunpro, which focuses on grammar and sentence construction through spaced repetition. Use Language Exchange and Speaking Practice:\nEngage in language exchange with native speakers. Platforms like HelloTalk or Tandem can connect you with Japanese speakers who want to learn your language. Practice speaking and constructing sentences in real-time, which can significantly improve your fluency and confidence. Write Regularly:\nKeep a diary or journal in Japanese. Start with simple sentences and gradually incorporate new vocabulary and grammar points. Participate in online forums or communities where you can write and receive feedback. Lang-8 or HiNative are platforms where you can get corrections from native speakers. Study with Audio and Visual Aids:\nListen to Japanese podcasts, watch dramas, or use apps like FluentU, which provide context and examples for new words and phrases. Mimic native speakers to improve your intonation and sentence flow. Mindset and Motivation: Set Realistic Goals:\nBreak down your study plan into manageable goals. Instead of \u0026ldquo;I need to pass the JLPT N3,\u0026rdquo; focus on smaller, achievable targets like \u0026ldquo;I will learn 10 new words this week.\u0026rdquo; Track Your Progress:\nKeep a log of what you’ve learned and the areas where you’ve improved. This can be motivating and help you see tangible progress over time. Stay Positive and Persistent:\nRemember, everyone learns at their own pace. Comparing yourself to others can be discouraging. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small. Connect with Other Learners:\nJoin study groups or online communities for JLPT preparation. Sharing experiences and tips with fellow learners can provide encouragement and practical advice. Recommended Resources: Grammar and Sentence Building:\nTae Kim\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Japanese Grammar: Comprehensive and free online resource.
