      <description>Another challange I do while learning programming, this is episode 1 by the way.
You can visit hacker101 if you want to play it too.
I start the level and it redirected me to a website with white background and a paragraph which said:
Welcome to level 0. Enjoy your stay. Nothing out of ordinary here. So, I inspect the page and look at the source code. Seems normal. Until I take a look at the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; tag and saw the following lines:</description>

      <description>Continue to Level 2. Here is the level goal:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory
I connected to the game server using the password from the previous level. The file needed to get the password for the next level is located at the home directory, so I just typed in:
cat ./- And the content get printed.
If I typed cat - the content inside - file won&amp;rsquo;t be printed since typing cat - means the cat command will read from standard input.</description>

      <description>After getting the password from Level 0, I connected to Level 1.
Here is the level goal by the way.
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.
This one is pretty straightforward.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing Bandit wargames in overthewire website, while doing so I want to share my journey here.
First level, it&amp;rsquo;s Level 0. The goal is to connect to the game server using ssh. This one is pretty straightforward, the only obstacle here is knowing how to use ssh.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m in a linux machine, I can easily read the manpage for ssh command.
The instruction for Level 0 is the following:</description>
