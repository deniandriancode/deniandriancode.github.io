      <description>Learning is a tiresome activity, you need to put a lot of effort and time when learning something, this is even true when learning something by yourself, like programming, since nobody is going to remind you when to study, when to review your note, when to exercise, what to study after you finished the current topic, in other word, you need to put extra effort because nobody is going to guide you whatsoever.</description>
