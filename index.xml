      <description>If you are learning programming or computer science related stuff, chances are you will write some code. Coding and programming are two different things, in a nutshell, programming is applying some logic while coding is actually typing the applied logic into machine-readable instruction, read this awesome article from freeCodeCamp.
You can do programming wherever you are, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to sit in front of your computer since applying some logic don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need a computer.</description>

      <description>Learning is a tiresome activity, you need to put a lot of effort and time when learning something, this is even true when learning something by yourself, like programming, since nobody is going to remind you when to study, when to review your note, when to exercise, what to study after you finished the current topic, in other word, you need to put extra effort because nobody is going to guide you whatsoever.</description>
