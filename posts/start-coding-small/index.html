  <div class="post-content"><p>If you are learning programming or computer science related stuff,
chances are you will write some code. Coding and programming are two
different things, in a nutshell, programming is applying some logic
while coding is actually typing the applied logic into machine-readable
instruction, read <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/difference-between-coding-and-programming/">this awesome article</a>
from freeCodeCamp.</p>
<p>You can do programming wherever you are, you don&rsquo;t have to sit in
front of your computer since applying some logic don&rsquo;t necessarily
need a computer.Think about how you study math, that&rsquo;s how you study
programming, more or less.</p>
<p>Studying coding, on the other hand, requires you to be in front of
your computer and type some code. Now, no matter how much you love
programming and coding, you still have to leave your computer, you
got other things to do and booting up your computer just to be able
to study code might feel a bit of a hassle.</p>
<p>Learning programming is important but if you can&rsquo;t implement what
you have learnt, it is practically useless, in other word, you just
waste your time. That&rsquo;s why you also need to learn how to code, learn
how to make you logic become reality and solve real world problems.</p>
<p>Booting up a computer just to typing some confusing text and make
your brain hurt doesn&rsquo;t sound very fun, that&rsquo;s being said, in this
article I want to share with you, how you can learn coding while
making it fun, or at least making coding less of a hassle.</p>

<p>What I mean with meaningless here is things that are not exciting
to do, it could be anything from doing daily habits to working on
the same problem multiple times.</p>
<p>For example, when you are hungry, you search for something to eat,
maybe you go to the kitchen and start making something or just order
it using online service, in the end you have something to eat and
start devouring it to satisfy your hunger.</p>
<p>Searching for food when we are hungry is an activity we do in daily
basis, we do it so often that sometimes we didn&rsquo;t think about it too
much, hungry means search for food to eat, done, there is no excitement
in doing such activity since we do it everyday—unless if we are visiting
a restaurant then it&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>When we do such activity without all of this emotional attributes, we actually
using less energy satisfy our need, since we just focus on doing the activity,
our body will use the energy to complete such task and not using it to other
things like the feeling of excitement.</p>
<p>In other word, meaningless things are just things we do automatically we
didn&rsquo;t give it much attention since we didn&rsquo;t really have to. Because, as you
can tell, giving attention to something is using a lot of energy.</p>
