Which is why keeping record of your learning journey is very important so you can know how far have you progressed, how far are you from your goals, what need to be evaluated from your previous experience and so forth.\nOne of the easiest way to keeping record of your learning journey is by taking a note. Now, there are a lot of ways to take a note nowadays, from using the notebook and pen to using computer or smartphone. However, when taking a note while learning programming I would highly recommend using digital based note taking method, or in this case, a computer, why? Because when you learn programming, most of the time you will be on your computer typing some code, that’s why using computer for taking a note will make it easier since you don’t have to switch around and write on a notebook, you can just switch to your note taking application as you learn.\nThere are a lot of note taking applications for computer, however here I want to show you how you can use web development as your note taking platform, and why you should use it especially is you are learning programming.\nRapid Change of Information Programming, just like other fields of technology, is evolving in a rapid speed. A tutorial on how to use certain framework in programming from 2 years ago might no be relevant by now since the framework has gone through some major update (this is my personal experience by the way). Everyday the developers keep adding new features and fixing bugs to make the software better, sometimes it takes several months to finish, sometimes it takes only several days to finish, in short, it changes really fast. Not to mention when a particular software got an update, it might affects other softwares, for instance, if the browser got an update, your javascript knowledge might need to be updated as well. If you were to write all this information on a notebook, it will get confusing real quick since your information on that notebook will most likely outdated, and there is now way to update the information unless writing on a new page, which is a waste. Moreover, if you need to include a link to certain website or documentation, it is difficult to do in notebook, you can’t just click it and open it on your browser. And there is picture and diagram, all of which cannot be stored easily on a notebook.\nWith that being said, the most logical thing to do to take a note while learning programming is to use digital platform, there are a lot of note taking programs for computer, but here I will use web development as a tool to take a note while learning programming. You maybe ask, why use web development instead of just use an existing program? Well, you can actually, but why just learn one thing if you can learn two at the same time? Of course this is just my opinion and you can completely ignore this article and throw it on a trash bin, however what I want to emphasize here is that how putting extra effort on learning something is actually a shortcut, or should I say “The easiest way to learn something is to learn it the hard way”, that is to put more effort on it, to put the work on it. Because the more difficult something to get, the more precious it is in our heart.\nBut I don’t learn web development!\nThat’s compeletely fine, you don’t have to build a full-blown web app for your note taking platform, just basic knowledge of html and css is enough since what you will do is just storing your note on the web. And when I mean on the web, I mean online, that is you can access the note from any device that browse the internet.\nWait, there are already exist such services!\nI know, and you can use that service, however when you build your own, you can learn how the internet works and the basic of web technology, it doesn’t matter what your expertise is, you will use the web every now and then, so yeah, it won’t hurt learning a little bit of web development.\nEnough with the reasoning, let’s see how we can use web development as our note taking platform while learning programming.\nNote Taking using Web Development I know I said that I will show you how we can use web development as your note taking platform, however I won’t be specific since note taking is different from person to person. What you need to build is just a simple web platform where you can store your notes, it doesn’t matter how you want it to look like or what it capable of, the most important one is that it can store notes easily and you can retrieve your note easily. There are a lot of free services to host such application. Here are just some that I know, you can use other services if you want.\n1. Wordpress Everybody knows Wordpress, if you’ve been on the internet for quite sometime chances are you already encountered a website powered by wordpress. Wordpress is a content management system or CMS for short, to put simply it makes managing your content easier since you don’t have to worry about the technical detail and only focus on your business instead. It has a free tier where you can create a website a basically make your own blog. Because of its easy to use nature, even non-tech savy people have been using wordpress for their online needs, it becomes one the most popular CMS out there. Because of its easy to use and popularity, I would recommend you to use wordpress as your note taking platform while learning programming, it is free and you almost don’t need any web development skill to use it. You still can learn about web development from using wordpress like url, domain name, and other basic things about the internet. The reason I recommend wordpress first is because you can actually start taking note and put it online on the internet for you and the world to see, there are a lot templates to choose from, the website has been styled for you, so you don’t have to fight error messages while taking a note.\n2. GitHub Pages GitHub offers a free hosting for static website called GitHub Pages. You can learn more on its official documentation. The difference between GitHub page and wordpress is that in GitHub page you really start from scratch, there is no template whatsoever. It is a good platform if you really want to learn the basic of web development like HTML and CSS while taking a note. While you can style it however you want, it all depends on your own effort since you really start building the website from scratch.\n3. Vercel Vercel is a bit specific because you have to use javascript to be able to use vercel. Javascript knowledge is required for using Vercel’s service, however if you want to use it as a note takning platform which only need a basic function such as storing and displaying text and images, you don’t need that much of javascript, a very basic knowledge of the language is enough to be able to use Vercel as your note taking platform. If you have a really creative ideas on your mind, Vercel is the perfect choice since it supports basically every major javascript framework, whatever you want to build using javascript, you can put it online on Vercel.\nDon’t Over Engineer your Note Taking Platform Being creative and all is good when using web development as your note taking platform, but don’t get carried away and focus only on designing and developing it, unless if you want to delve into web development then it is a different story, if you want to use it just as your note taking platform however, it doesn’t have to be good or eye-candy, it just have to be readable and easy for you to use. The idea of using web development as your note taking platform is that to make writing and accessing your note easier, since while learning programming you will most likely be in front of your monitor typing some code, it just makes more sense to choose what’s easier for you to use at that moment, plus you can learn the basic of the internet, things that you will encounter no matter what field of programming you focus on.\nUse the Already Existing Services Using web development as a note taking platform is not for everyone, if you don’t feel like learning a whole new field of programming just to store your note, that’s completely fine, as a matter of fact, if developing a whole new project just to store your note feels like a burden, don’t do it, since there are already a lot of existing services that offer similar things. Below I list just a few of them but you can certainly use other service if you want.\n1. Obsidian Obsidian is one of the most popular note taking app out there, it available on the web, pc, and mobile. It has a lot of features, it uses markdown syntax and stores the file in a markdown file, making transferring your notes across devices a lot easier. If you don’t know what features you would expect from a note taking app, use Obsidian, it won’t dissapoint you.\n2. Google Keep I haven’t use Google Keep at all, to be honest I don’t even know google has a note taking app. Anyways, there is it there for you to use.\n3. GitHub This one is the GitHub itself and the GitHub Pages I mentioned above. If you have a README.md file on your repository, GitHub will render it automatically when you visit the directory of that README.md file. Of course you can just use any file format and store it on GitHub, what makes it different is that you can easily change between “versions” of your note just like when you developing an actual software.\nAfterword I hope you learn something new after reading this post, even just a little, giving positive impact through my writing is something I always dream of especially in the field of programming and mathematics. All I said in this article is purely just my opinion, if you have other opinion on how to store a note when learning programming, let me know, I love sharing thoughts and ideas about anything related to programming and mathematics.\nThat’s all from me, I hope we meet again on another post.\nStay safe.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Learning is a tiresome activity, you need to put a lot of effort and time when learning something,
this is even true when learning something by yourself, like programming, since nobody is going to
remind you when to study, when to review your note, when to exercise, what to study after you
finished the current topic, in other word, you need to put extra effort because nobody is going
to guide you whatsoever. Which is why keeping record of your learning journey is very important
so you can know how far have you progressed, how far are you from your goals, what need to be

<p>There are a lot of note taking applications for computer, however here I want to show you how you

are learning programming.</p>
<h2 id="rapid-change-of-information">Rapid Change of Information<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rapid-change-of-information">#</a></h2>
<p>Programming, just like other fields of technology, is evolving in a rapid speed. A tutorial on
how to use certain framework in programming from 2 years ago might no be relevant by now since
the framework has gone through some major update (this is my personal experience by the way). Everyday
the developers keep adding new features and fixing bugs to make the software better, sometimes
it takes several months to finish, sometimes it takes only several days to finish, in short, it
changes really fast. Not to mention when a particular software got an update, it might affects other
softwares, for instance, if the browser got an update, your javascript knowledge might need to be updated as well.
If you were to write all this information on a notebook, it will get confusing real quick since your
information on that notebook will most likely outdated, and there is now way to update the information
unless writing on a new page, which is a waste. Moreover, if you need to include a link to certain website
or documentation, it is difficult to do in notebook, you can&rsquo;t just click it and open it on your browser.
And there is picture and diagram, all of which cannot be stored easily on a notebook.</p>
<p>With that being said, the most logical thing to do to take a note while learning programming is
to use digital platform, there are a lot of note taking programs for computer, but here I will use
web development as a tool to take a note while learning programming. You maybe ask, why use web

putting extra effort on learning something is actually a shortcut, or should I say &ldquo;The easiest way to

Because the more difficult something to get, the more precious it is in our heart.</p>
<p><strong>But I don&rsquo;t learn web development!</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s compeletely fine, you don&rsquo;t have to build a full-blown web app for your note taking platform,
just basic knowledge of html and css is enough since what you will do is just storing your note on the web.
And when I mean on the web, I mean online, that is you can access the note from any device that browse the
internet.</p>
<p><strong>Wait, there are already exist such services!</strong></p>
<p>I know, and you can use that service, however when you build your own, you can learn how the internet
works and the basic of web technology, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what your expertise is, you will use the

<p>GitHub offers a free hosting for static website called <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. You can learn more on its official documentation. The
difference between GitHub page and wordpress is that in GitHub page you really start from scratch, there
is no template whatsoever. It is a good platform if you really want to learn the basic of web development
like HTML and CSS while taking a note. While you can style it however you want, it all depends on your
own effort since you really start building the website from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="3-vercel">3. Vercel<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-vercel">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is a bit specific because you have to use javascript to be able to use vercel. Javascript knowledge
is required for using Vercel&rsquo;s service, however if you want to use it as a note takning platform which
only need a basic function such as storing and displaying text and images, you don&rsquo;t need that much of
javascript, a very basic knowledge of the language is enough to be able to use Vercel as your note taking
platform. If you have a really creative ideas on your mind, Vercel is the perfect choice since it supports
basically every major javascript framework, whatever you want to build using javascript, you can put it
online on Vercel.</p>
<h2 id="dont-over-engineer-your-note-taking-platform">Don&rsquo;t Over Engineer your Note Taking Platform<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dont-over-engineer-your-note-taking-platform">#</a></h2>
<p>Being creative and all is good when using web development as your note taking platform, but don&rsquo;t get carried
away and focus only on designing and developing it, unless if you want to delve into web development then it
is a different story, if you want to use it just as your note taking platform however, it doesn&rsquo;t have to
be good or eye-candy, it just have to be readable and easy for you to use. The idea of using web development
as your note taking platform is that to make writing and accessing your note easier, since while learning
programming you will most likely be in front of your monitor typing some code, it just makes more sense to
choose what&rsquo;s easier for you to use at that moment, plus you can learn the basic of the internet, things that
you will encounter no matter what field of programming you focus on.</p>
<h2 id="use-the-already-existing-services">Use the Already Existing Services<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#use-the-already-existing-services">#</a></h2>
<p>Using web development as a note taking platform is not for everyone, if you don&rsquo;t feel like learning a whole
new field of programming just to store your note, that&rsquo;s completely fine, as a matter of fact, if developing
a whole new project just to store your note feels like a burden, don&rsquo;t do it, since there are already a lot
of existing services that offer similar things. Below I list just a few of them but you can certainly use other
service if you want.</p>
<h3 id="1-obsidian">1. Obsidian<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-obsidian">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is one of the most popular note taking app out there, it available on the web, pc, and mobile. It has
a lot of features, it uses markdown syntax and stores the file in a markdown file, making transferring your
notes across devices a lot easier. If you don&rsquo;t know what features you would expect from a note taking app,
use Obsidian, it won&rsquo;t dissapoint you.</p>
<h3 id="2-google-keep">2. Google Keep<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-google-keep">#</a></h3>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t use <a href="https://keep.google.com/">Google Keep</a> at all, to be honest I don&rsquo;t even know google has
a note taking app. Anyways, there is it there for you to use.</p>
<h3 id="3-github">3. GitHub<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-github">#</a></h3>
<p>This one is the GitHub itself and the GitHub Pages I mentioned above. If you have a README.md file on your
repository, GitHub will render it automatically when you visit the directory of that README.md file. Of course
you can just use any file format and store it on GitHub, what makes it different is that you can easily
change between &ldquo;versions&rdquo; of your note just like when you developing an actual software.</p>
<h2 id="afterword">Afterword<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#afterword">#</a></h2>
<p>I hope you learn something new after reading this post, even just a little, giving positive impact through my writing
is something I always dream of especially in the field of programming and mathematics. All I said in this article
is purely just my opinion, if you have other opinion on how to store a note when learning programming, let me know,
I love sharing thoughts and ideas about anything related to programming and mathematics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all from me, I hope we meet again on another post.</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>
